# Jonnathan-bot

this might turn out to be a shitty bot idc

Here is a link to invite the bot: [click me](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=718998971799961701&scope=bot&permissions=3394566)

I have coded the bot but it's is really bad and making it open source will make me change that :)

## installation

I would recommand installing [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) first.

Then open terminal/cmd in your desired location (do not open cmd as admin in windows) and paste in `git clone https://github.com/E-boi/Jonnathan-bot`. You should see a folder named `Jonnathan-bot`. Paste `cd ./Jonnathan-bot` to enter the folder in your terminal. Paste in `npm i` to install dependencies. Edit the [config](https://github.com/E-boi/Jonnathan-bot#config-example) (see below) first. To run the bot do `npm run start`.

## Config example

Make a file in the root folder named `config.json`. And add your bot token. it should look something like this

```json
{
	"token": "your bot token"
}
```
